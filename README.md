# Socket IO Exercise

## Authors
+ [Dave Harms](https://github.com/daveharmswebdev)
+ [Marshall Friskics-Warren](https://github.com/wmfwarren)

## Goals
+ To work with and learn multi user socket io techniques
+ To understand how to effectively modularize server side code with sockets and Express
+ To learn to implement login with sockets
+ To understand how more complex socket *room* setups are made

## Work Flow
We focused initially on a pair coding work flow. Features implemented in this way include:
+ Broke sockets and server out into a factory
+ Made rooms for games
+ Modularized server side code
Dave had a particular interest in adding a dashboard component to the project. His goal was to have the latest results from active games in the console to all users in the lobby, without displaying the result in other game rooms. So he implemented this feature.
